# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

The data set link is 

" https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud ".

Here, I am build a model using ML Model(python) for find Credit Card Fraud.

As a data scientist, we do Analysis (EDA) of data and build the ML model to Pridict the Transaction is Fraud or Not. We have a Unbalance data of ratio 99:1 so, we used the SMOTE, ADASYN technique to balance the data. We basically estimate the Four different types of models on the dataset becausethe output of our dataset was divided into categories and the following models are:
Logistic Regression,
Decision Tree,
Random Forest,
KNN Classifier
